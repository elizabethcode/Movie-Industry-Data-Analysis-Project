# Movie Industry Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview  
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a curated dataset containing 40 movies from the entertainment industry. The primary objective is to extract actionable insights into box office revenue, audience ratings, genre performance, and budget impacts using clean and reliable data.

By employing advanced data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques in Power BI, this analysis facilitates informed decision-making and strategic planning within the entertainment sector.

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Power BI Desktop**: Data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and interactive visualization  
- **Microsoft Excel**: Initial dataset preparation  
- **SQL Concepts (via Power Query)**: Data manipulation and cleaning

## Data Preparation and Cleaning  
- Addressed missing and inconsistent IMDb ratings to improve data accuracy.  
- Standardized genre classifications, ensuring uniformity (e.g., “sci fi” corrected to “Sci-Fi”).  
- Converted textual budget entries such as “100 million” into numerical values for quantitative analysis.  
- Translated descriptive duration values (e.g., “Two hours”) into consistent numeric formats.  
- Removed duplicate records to maintain dataset integrity.  

These efforts ensured a clean, high-quality dataset suitable for robust analysis.

## Key Visualizations and Insights
